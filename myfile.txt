Hello, my name is Morgan Martin and I'd like to apply for the Front End Web Developer position you posted on on your company website. Geocent caught my eye because a friend of mine who is also applying said that he enjoyed your interview process and that you are looking for more strong developers. Through some of my own personal research it appears that Geocent is very solution centric with a strong engineering culture and I really appreciate that. 

I'm a developer who's worked with web technologies across the full stack, from the basics like HTML/CSS to server-side scripting with Ruby, Sinatra and Ruby on Rails, to front-end scripting with JavaScript, jQuery and AngularJS and also testing frameworks like RSpec. I recently built a social network for college students called App.ly as part of a team of 6 using an SCRUM-based Agile Development workflow. I've also worked on dozens of smaller projects while picking up the above-mentioned technologies, from a social network application to a youtube playlist generator.

I've learned incredibly fast so far and I'd love to keep learning and building as a part of your team so I hope we can chat soon to see if it's a good fit. I've attached my resume and you can reach me directly at morganm5201@gmail.com to set something up.

Sincerely,
Morgan Martin
